First, install npm. npm is the software registry, which allows to share, use code, and lets easy to update the shared code. npm is distributed with Node.js and is installed with Node.js.\nNode.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.\nEngine processes JavaScript in the browser. Another words, it compiles the JavaScript code to native machine code. \n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>Create directories by running the following commands in terminal:</p>\n            <div className='box'>\n            mkdir [name]\n            cd [name]\n            mkdir -p src/components src/styles\n            </div>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                [name] is the name of the folder\n                mkdir creates new folder — makes directory\n                cd changes directory\n                mkdir -p src/components src/styles creates a folder src with folders styles and components (-p is path)\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>Additional commands:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                pwd prints working directory\n                    ls lists information about files\n                    mv move or rename files or directories (mv -f [file name] [new place])\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n            <br />\n            <p>Tostart new Node.js project, run the command npm init to answer the following questions below or press ENTER to skip questions one by one.
